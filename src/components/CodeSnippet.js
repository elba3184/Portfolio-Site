            I began my journey into software development back in August 2014.
          </span>
          <span>
            While attending the <b>University of Florida</b>, I took Mathematics
            and Computer
          </span>
          <span>
            Science coursework on top of my Philosophy classes. Naturally, I
            became
          </span>
          <span>
            addicted to Starbucks coffee for survival üò¨. In between the
            madness, I
          </span>
          <span>
            discovered a passion for <i>robotics</i> and <i>engineering</i> in
            its various forms.
          </span>
          <span>
            After a few projects, I joined and later became the President of
          </span>
          <span>Gator Robotics ü§ñ.</span>

          <span></span>

          <span>
            I graduated from UF in December 2018 with a
            <b> Bachelor's of Art in Philosophy üìù.</b>
          </span>
          <span>
            Wanting to begin a career in software development, I attended

          <span>
            <b>Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp</b> in Miami, FL in August
            2019. I met
          </span>
          <span>
            amazing developers, built fun projects, and grew my skillset
            exponentially üìà.
          </span>
          <span>
            I graduated from Ironhack in October 2019 üéä and took my first job
            as a

          <span>Frontend Web Developer in January 2020.</span>
