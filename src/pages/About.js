      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Who Is Annie? head-shot of Annie Liew. A curiosity-driven Front-End
        Developer with design chops. I'm passionate about bringing both the
        technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. I care deeply
        about the user experience, beautiful pixels and writing clean accessible
        code that's readable by humans. And as a follower of John Maeda’s Laws
        Of Simplicity, I agree that less is more.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with industry experience in Front-End
        Web Development looking to continue building my knowledge and skill set.
        I'm open to relocation or remote-work. I graduated from Ironhack’s
        Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp in October 2019 and from the
        University of Florida in December 2018. As my background speaks for
        itself, I have a strong passion for engineering, programming, and
        robotics. My interest in web development comes from a desire to blend my
        love for programming with my design background.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently seeking new opportunities in the Big Apple (New York
        City)! Please feel free to reach out and see I could be a match for you!
