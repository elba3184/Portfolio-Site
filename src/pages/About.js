        I'm a passionate Full-Stack Web Developer driven to make projects come
        to life. During my time at the University of Florida, I discovered an
        interest in robotics. I am a Full-Stack Web Developer with industry
        experience in Front-End Web Development looking to continue building my
        knowledge and skill set. I'm open to relocation or remote-work. I
        graduated from Ironhack‚Äôs Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp in October
        2019 and from the University of Florida in December 2018. As my
        background speaks for itself, I have a strong passion for engineering,
        programming, and robotics. My interest in web development comes from a
        desire to blend my love for programming with my design background.

        I'm currently seeking new opportunities in the Big üçé(New York City)!
